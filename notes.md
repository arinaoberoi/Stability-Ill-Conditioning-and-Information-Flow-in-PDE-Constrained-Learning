## Why this project exists

Many learning-based solvers for PDE-governed inverse problems appear to succeed
because optimization converges. However, convergence does not imply stability.

This project studies:
- when learning masks ill-conditioning
- when PDE structure restores stability
- how information flow diagnostics distinguish real recovery from artifact

The goal is not better benchmarks, but better understanding.
